Now, cases have risen to levels not seen since near the peak of the pandemic.\\n\"Something is not working in Quebec,\" said Dr. Nima Machouf, an epidemiologist at l\\'Université de Montréal. \"When we look at the numbers, we look at Quebec and we compare it to the rest of Canada. In Quebec, it\\'s not going well. In Ontario, they\\'re a much larger population, but they have half as many patients. \"\\nThe provincial government\\'s response, she and several other experts told the Montreal Gazette on Monday, lacked severity early, when the second wave was still a bump. A failure to prevent private gatherings in early September probably contributed to the new surge in infections, they said, which is prompting the government to institute new, lockdown-like measures in Quebec City and Montreal.\\nQuebec Health Minister Christian Dubé and Dr. Horacio Arruda, the director of public health, repeatedly urged the public to avoid gatherings indoors but took no further measures to prevent them from happening.\\n\"Is it the message that didn\\'t come through?\" Machouf wondered. \"They never stopped telling us to stop gathering indoors. We know there is a risk of contagion.\"\\nSome experts said the government needed to emphasize communicating clear policies to Quebecers. A volley of inconsistent messages, they said, left room for people to bend or break the guidelines or fell upon the deaf ears of a tired public who had lived through a lockdown and were enjoying their freedom.\\nDr. Matthew Oughton, an infectious disease specialist at the Jewish General Hospital and assistant professor in the department of medicine at McGill University, said Dubé\\'s recent plea for Quebecers to avoid social gatherings for 28 days lacked clarity.\\n\"It\\'s not clear whether it\\'s a suggestion or a strongly worded request,\" he said. \"It doesn\\'t appear to have the force of law and yet with the current level of transmission that we\\'re seeing, clear action is needed.\"\\nOughton and other experts also questioned the government\\'s refusal to mandate masks in classrooms. Non-medical masks are mandatory indoors throughout the province, but not for schoolchildren in classrooms or in theatres, when attendees are sitting down.\\n\"They cannot give mixed messages that don\\'t make any sense,\" said Dr. Parisa Ariya, a professor in the departments of atmospheric and oceanic sciences and chemistry at McGill University who has published numerous articles on the spread of bioaerosols.\\nShe said a collection of newly published research indicates that the virus can spread farther than two metres and criticized the government\\'s failure to mandate masks in all indoor settings. It adds ambiguity to a problem that, in her view, should be clear cut: masks work. When people are indoors together, in any setting, they should wear them, she insisted.\\n\"Indoors is the worst place (for the virus),\" she said.\\nHealth officials should have erred on the side of caution rather than downplayed and resisted evidence pointing to the possibility that the virus can spread as an aerosol, she argued. Masks should have been made mandatory indoors earlier, and they should now be worn at gatherings of all kinds, she said.\\nSome experts expressed sympathy with government decision-makers. Officials in Quebec have been trying to walk a careful tightrope: on one side, they are attempting to limit the economic and social impacts of lockdown measures; on the other side, they want to prevent cases from rising to dangerous levels.\\n\"I certainly don\\'t envy my colleagues at public health for having to make these decisions,\" said Dr. Brian Ward, a professor in the department of medicine at McGill University, \"because it\\'s pretty easy to look back, three, four weeks later and say \\'OK, that\\'s not what we wanted to happen.\\' \"\\nAlthough COVID-19 cases are climbing in many countries and in several other Canadian provinces, Quebec remains the epicentre of the pandemic in Canada, as it was in the spring.\\n\"The first time, it is conceivable that Quebec was disadvantaged by having an early spring break and an influx of travellers and all this other stuff, but this time we don\\'t have that as a reason,\" Oughton said.\\nCases of COVID-19 are rising in countries around the world: the U.K., Poland, the Netherlands and Spain, but each country is responding to the pandemic differently and some are having better results than others. South Korea, for example, has aggressively stamped out the infection and appears to have repressed a second wave.\\nThe experts who spoke to the Montreal Gazette said Quebec should actively seek lessons from other countries and follow their leads.\\n\"We have to learn from others,\" Machouf said. \"We have to see what are the others doing that we\\'re doing poorly. That\\'s the way we will be able to solve the problem.\"\\nmlapierre@postmedia.com\\nRelated\\nLongueuil high school shut down as COVID-19 infects 7 teachers, 26 students\\nCoronavirus live updates: Swamped test centres may turn away low-risk people, Quebec warns\\nAll our coronavirus-related news can be found at montrealgazette.com/tag/coronavirus\\nSign up for our email newsletter dedicated to local COVID-19 coverage at montrealgazette.com/coronavirusnews\\nHelp support our local journalism by subscribing to the Montreal Gazette here\\nYou might also be interested in...\\nRecords reveal chaos in the days before staff abandoned the Herron\\nFake nurse in Quebec discovered and fired after 20 years on the job\\nFitness: Do you really need to log 10,000 steps a day?\\n\\n',\n"," 'date': 'Sep 29, 2020',\n"," 'source': 'Blog, Podcast, or W ebsite',\n"," 'id': '2447104249',\n"," 'subject': ['Public health',\n","  'Coronaviruses',\n","  'Pandemics',\n","  'Masks',\n","  'Disease transmission',\n","  'COVID-19']}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":46}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data = []\n","\n","# Iterate over the topic distributions for each text\n","for i, doc_topics in enumerate(topic_distributions):\n","    # Sort the topics in descending order of probability\n","    sorted_topics = sorted(doc_topics, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n","\n","    # Retrieve the most probable topic\n","    most_probable_topic = sorted_topics[0]\n","    topic_id, topic_prob = most_probable_topic\n","\n","    # Assign the corresponding topic label to the text based on the topic_id\n","    topic_label = topic_labels[topic_id]\n","\n","    # Retrieve the content of the text from unique_list\n","    text_content = unique_list[i]['full_text']\n","\n","    # Append the data to the list\n","    data.append({'Text': text_content, 'Topic Label': topic_label, 'Probability': topic_prob})\n","\n","# Create the dataframe\n","df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2MV4WW2Zs2pd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1687902146267,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":2592,"user":{"displayName":"muchen wang","userId":"10267862332018942613"}},"outputId":"6c30ae2d-383c-41f3-efdb-5981d0f9f485"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/ipykernel/ipkernel.py:283: DeprecationWarning: `should_run_async` will not call `transform_cell` automatically in the future.
