When J.F. Chaumont of the Journal de Montréal spotted Radulov in the treatment room beside the Stars locker room he asked the Russian if he could come out to talk.\"Talk to Bergy,\" Radulov told Chaumont.After posting 18-36-54 totals in 76 games with the Canadiens during the 2016-17 season, Radulov left for Dallas after Canadiens GM Marc Bergevin made final \"first-come, first-served\" contract offers to Radulov and Andrei Markov and then lost both of them as free agents. Radulov signed a five-year contract worth $31.25 million with an annual salary-cap hit of $6.25 million with the Stars, while Markov went back home to Russia to play for Kazan Ak-Bars, where he won the KHL\\'s Gagarin Cup.Last season with the Stars, Radulov posted 27-45-72 totals while playing in all 82 games. This season, the 32-year-old has 5-6-11 totals in seven games. Radulov returned to the Stars lineup Tuesday night after missing the previous four games with a lower-body injury. He logged 21:04 of ice time against the Canadiens, with two shots, two hits, a plus-1 and the empty-net goal.\"He\\'s obviously a big part of our team,\" the Stars\\' Jason Spezza said after the game about Radulov. \"He\\'s an emotional guy, he\\'s a physical player. He protects pucks well. He\\'s a big part of our team, so it was nice to get him back. I think the more and more he plays he\\'ll get back up to speed. But just to have him there emotionally it was important for us.\"After the game, Canadiens coach Claude Julien said his team wasn\\'t focused on Radulov.\"Our game plan wasn\\'t to shut down Radulov,\" Julien said. \"Our game plan was to more or less shut down their best players and it\\'s more than Radulov. I think when you look at guys like (Jamie) Benn and guys like (Tyler) Seguin it was important for us to shut them down. But their power play is what hurt us the most, I think, tonight.\"Officially, the Stars were 1-for-6 on the power play, but one of their goals came only seconds after a power play had finished. The Canadiens went 0-for-4 on the power play.The Canadiens continued to struggle in the faceoff circle, winning only 44 per cent of the draws.Alexander Radulov returns to the lineup (and to Montreal) tonight. #GoStars pic.twitter.com/Wto9ZMal6j- Dallas Stars (@DallasStars) October 30, 2018Bell Centre fans boo RadulovCanadiens fans loved Radulov when he was in Montreal, but they booed him almost every time he touched the puck Tuesday night.There are some fans who believe Radulov was greedy to leave Montreal - calling him \"Greedulov\" - after Bergevin took a chance on the Russian, signing him to join the Canadiens as a free agent after he had spent four seasons with CSKA Moscow in the KHL.Personally, I have no problem with Radulov or any other NHL player trying to get as much money as they can from whatever team wants to pay them since their careers are short. And when it comes to greed, NHL owners are more guilty of that since they lock out the players every chance they can to get what they want in collective bargaining - taking the game away from the fans in the process. Don\\'t be surprised if there\\'s another lockout in 2020.As Bergevin once said himself: \"If you want loyalty, buy a dog.\"Wheels fall off for Habs after fast startThe Canadiens got off to a fast start against the Stars, outshooting them 10-2 in the first period.Then while the Canadiens\\' were short-handed, Artturi Lehkonen was awarded a penalty shot only 48 seconds into the second period. He was stopped trying to shoot for the five-hole against Stars goalie Ben Bishop and then the wheels fell off for the Canadiens.The Stars\\' Esa Lindell scored a power-play goal at 1:49 of the second period when the shots were 12-4 for the Canadiens and then Miro Heiskanen made it 2-0 at the 7:24 mark and the Stars never looked back.Brendan Gallagher made things interesting when he scored his team-leading seventh goal of the season for the Canadiens at 2:58 of the third period, banging in a rebound from the top of the crease - where else? The Stars called for a goalie-interference video review, but the goal counted because Gallagher had been pushed into Bishop by defenceman John Klinberg.The Stars\\' Devin Shore delivered the knockout blow with a short-handed goal at 9:27 of the third period after Lehkonen was stripped of the puck in front of his own net. Radulov put the finishing touch on the Stars\\' victory when he scored into an empty net at 17:23.Canadiens goalie Carey Price, coming off a 3-0 shutout win Saturday night in Boston, allowed three goals on the 21 shots he faced as the Canadiens outshot the Stars 35-22.The Canadiens saw their record fall to 6-3-2.\"It wasn\\'t the greatest game,\" Julien said. \"I\\'m not going to stand here and say our effort wasn\\'t good. There was a good effort. Now, did we play well enough? That\\'s another thing. I don\\'t think we played well enough, but I can\\'t complain about the effort. I think the guys were trying. Some nights things go a lot better than others. I felt especially in the second period we lacked cohesion (with) too many of the Ds and forwards and we weren\\'t generating as much.\"The Stars improved their record to 6-5-0 with their first road win of the season.\"A tough game,\" Spezza said. \"We know how well they\\'ve been playing and I thought they outplayed us in the first and Bish stood tall and gave us a chance. Then I thought we did a really good job in the second of really taking over the game by cycling and playing a hard, heavy game and did a lot of good things.\"Lehkonen gets a shorthanded penalty shot, but is denied by Ben Bishop. pic.twitter.com/6P9fHQAvCW- Scott Matla (@scottmatla) October 31, 2018Byron suffers lower-body injuryThe Canadiens didn\\'t make any lineup changes against the Stars, meaning forwards Andrew Shaw and Nikita Scherbak were healthy scratches again and defenceman Noah Juulsen sat out with a minor upper-body injury.The Canadiens\\' Paul Byron suffered a lower-body injury during the second period and did not return to the game.\"No idea on Paulie,\" Julien said after the game when asked if he had an update on Byron\\'s injury.Buckets @tseguinofficial pic.twitter.com/THYGF2YeWw- Dallas Stars (@DallasStars) October 30, 2018Scherbak sent to Laval RocketAfter the game, the Canadiens announced that Scherbak, who has been a healthy scratch for all 11 games this season, was being sent to the AHL\\'s Laval Rocket for conditioning purposes. Scherbak was the Canadiens\\' first-round pick (26th overall) at the 2014 NHL Draft.\"Scherbak needs to go and play,\" Julien said. \"He hasn\\'t played in over a month. I\\'m not sure it\\'s fair to throw him in the lineup here, where he hasn\\'t played in a while. I think a good conditioning stint and make sure that when he comes back he\\'s got some games under his belt. So that was the intention behind it and I think it\\'s important for him to find his game and for us to have a better player when we need him.\"Domi\\'s streak comes to an endThe Canadiens\\' Max Domi saw his six-game point streak - during which he posted 5-3-8 totals - come to an end against the Stars, finishing the game minus-2 with two shots on goal while winning only 5 of 14 faceoffs (36 per cent). Domi\\'s linemates, Jonathan Drouin and Lehkonen, were also pointless.\"I think that Domi\\'s line with Dru and Lehky tonight they didn\\'t have it as much as they\\'ve had it lately,\" Julien said. \"Those things happen. So I\\'m not going to stand here and dwell on one game. Let\\'s see what we can do and bounce back for the next one.\"Fourth line needs to chip inThe Canadiens\\' new, fast-paced style is a lot easier to play when Julien can roll four lines - especially over the course of the long, 82-game schedule.The fourth line against the Stars had Matthew Peca at centre between Nicolas Deslauriers and Charles Hudon. The line was pointless with Hudon logging 11:56 of ice time, Peca 11:37 and Deslauriers 10:33.After Tuesday\\'s morning skate, Julien was asked how much ice time he\\'d like to see his fourth line get each game.\"I wouldn\\'t want you guys to dissect that system and ice time and that,\" the coach said. \"I think at the end of the day, what I would tell you is that in order for us to get the maximum out of our lineup we do need our fourth line. Do we need them for 18 minutes? No, not really. But we need them to bring us some good presence where it\\'s going to give us the energy, it\\'s going to bring something - whether it\\'s the forecheck creates offensive chances, whether it\\'s being on the ice at times when I really need them against top lines and being able to give us those kind of shifts. But I think we need them for sure.\"As far as time is concerned, I think a lot of it depends on the game,\" Julien added. \"There\\'s no doubt we need four lines, not just in the system. In today\\'s game, you look at most teams and I don\\'t think we\\'re much different than anybody else as far as the amount of ice time, but I think every team knows nowadays with the schedule and the way the game is played - the pace of the game has picked up in the last few years - you have to be able to rely on your fourth line.\"Last season, Julien struggled to find an identity on his fourth line. This season, the coach says the fourth line will have two identities.\"I think some of it depends on who we\\'re playing,\" Julien said. \"We\\'ve been able to try and use those two identities, whether it\\'s been a little bit more grit or whether it\\'s been giving us a little bit more balance on the attack - and I think a lot of it depends who\\'s on the other side. What kind of team you\\'re playing and how they play and we\\'ve been able to kind of adjust accordingly.\"There will be a lot of NHL scouts in Bell Centre press box for tonight\\'s game between #Habs and ?@DallasStars? #HabsIO pic.twitter.com/rxDpXvgGOC- Stu Cowan (@StuCowan1) October 30, 2018Armia on the power playJoel Armia continues to have a spot on the Canadiens\\' second power-play unit even though he has never scored a power-play goal and has only six power-play assists in 191 career NHL games.Armia has 2-2-4 totals in 11 games this season.\"There\\'s a lot of guys that are good right now that aren\\'t really scoring,\" Julien said. \"Lehkonen\\'s another one of them (with only one goal this season).

He signed a one-year, two-way deal with the Canadiens that pays him US$700,000 in the NHL and $275,000 in the AHL.Ouellet earned a spot among the Canadiens\\' top six defencemen during training camp and has yet to miss a game this season. He logged 18:49 of ice time against the Stars and was even in plus/minus. For the season, Ouellet has 0-3-3 totals and is minus-2 while averaging 16:39 of ice time.\"I\\'m really happy for sure,\" Ouellet said about his performance after Tuesday\\'s morning skate. \"I always believed I could do it ... it was just a matter of actually getting the opportunity and taking it. I prepared well, I had a good camp, personally. I think the most fun right now is the way the team\\'s going.\"Most nights this season you probably haven\\'t noticed Ouellet on the ice, which is a good thing for a No. 5 or No. 6 defenceman.\"As a D, I think it is a good thing if you don\\'t get noticed,\" Ouellet said. \"Especially the type of game I play ...

Montgomery, a Montreal native, would only play five games with the Canadiens. Carbonneau spent one season with the Blues before getting traded to Dallas, where he spent five seasons with the Stars and won the Stanley Cup in 1999.Before joining the Stars this season, Montgomery spent five seasons as head coach at the University of Denver.What\\'s next?The Canadiens will practise at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday in Brossard and will be back in action Thursday night when the Washington Capitals visit the Bell Centre (7:30 p.m., TSN2, RDS, TSN 690 Radio).

When J.F. Chaumont of the Journal de Montréal spotted Radulov in the treatment room beside the Stars locker room he asked the Russian if he could come out to talk.\"Talk to Bergy,\" Radulov told Chaumont.After posting 18-36-54 totals in 76 games with the Canadiens during the 2016-17 season, Radulov left for Dallas after Canadiens GM Marc Bergevin made final \"first-come, first-served\" contract offers to Radulov and Andrei Markov and then lost both of them as free agents. Radulov signed a five-year contract worth $31.25 million with an annual salary-cap hit of $6.25 million with the Stars, while Markov went back home to Russia to play for Kazan Ak-Bars, where he won the KHL\\'s Gagarin Cup.Last season with the Stars, Radulov posted 27-45-72 totals while playing in all 82 games. This season, the 32-year-old has 6-6-11 totals in seven games. Radulov returned to the Stars lineup Tuesday night after missing the previous four games with a lower-body injury. He logged 21:04 of ice time against the Canadiens, with two shots, two hits, a plus-1 and the empty-net goal.\"He\\'s obviously a big part of our team,\" the Stars\\' Jason Spezza said about Radulov. \"He\\'s an emotional guy, he\\'s a physical player. He protects pucks well. He\\'s a big part of our team, so it was nice to get him back. I think the more and more he plays he\\'ll get back up to speed. But just to have him there emotionally it was important for us.\"After the game, Canadiens coach Claude Julien said his team wasn\\'t focused on Radulov.\"Our game plan wasn\\'t to shut down Radulov,\" Julien said. \"Our game plan was to more or less shut down their best players and it\\'s more than Radulov. I think when you look at guys like (Jamie) Benn and guys like (Tyler) Seguin it was important for us to shut them down. But their power play is what hurt us the most, I think, tonight.\"Officially, the Stars were 1-for-6 on the power play, but one of their goals came only seconds after a power play had finished. The Canadiens went 0-for-4 on the power play.The Canadiens continued to struggle in the faceoff circle, winning only 44 per cent of the draws.Alexander Radulov returns to the lineup (and to Montreal) tonight. #GoStars pic.twitter.com/Wto9ZMal6j- Dallas Stars (@DallasStars) October 30, 2018Bell Centre fans boo RadulovCanadiens fans loved Radulov when he was in Montreal, but they booed him almost every time he touched the puck Tuesday night.There are some fans who believe Radulov was greedy to leave Montreal - calling him \"Greedulov\" - after Bergevin took a chance on the Russian, signing him to join the Canadiens as a free agent after he had spent four seasons with CSKA Moscow in the KHL.Personally, I have no problem with Radulov or any other NHL player trying to get as much money as they can from whatever team wants to pay them since their careers are short. And when it comes to greed, NHL owners are more guilty of that since they lock out the players every chance they can to get what they want in collective bargaining - taking the game away from the fans in the process. Don\\'t be surprised if there\\'s another lockout in 2020.As Bergevin once said himself: \"If you want loyalty, buy a dog.\"Wheels fall off for Habs after fast startThe Canadiens got off to a fast start against the Stars, outshooting them 10-2 in the first period.Then while the Canadiens\\' were short-handed, Artturi Lehkonen was awarded a penalty shot only 48 seconds into the second period. He was stopped trying to shoot for the five-hole against Stars goalie Ben Bishop and then the wheels fell off for the Canadiens.The Stars\\' Esa Lindell scored a power-play goal at 1:49 of the second period when the shots were 12-4 for the Canadiens and then Miro Heiskanen made it 2-0 at the 7:24 mark and the Stars never looked back.Brendan Gallagher made things interesting when he scored his team-leading seventh goal of the season for the Canadiens at 2:58 of the third period, banging in a rebound from the top of the crease - where else? The Stars called for a goalie-interference video review, but the goal counted because Gallagher had been pushed into Bishop by defenceman John Klinberg.The Stars\\' Devin Shore delivered the knockout blow with a short-handed goal at 9:27 of the third period after Lehkonen was stripped of the puck in front of his own net. Radulov put the finishing touch on the Stars\\' victory when he scored into an empty net at 17:23.Canadiens goalie Carey Price, coming off a 3-0 shutout win Saturday night in Boston, allowed three goals on the 21 shots he faced as the Canadiens outshot the Stars 35-22.The Canadiens saw their record fall to 6-3-2.\"It wasn\\'t the greatest game,\" Julien said. \"I\\'m not going to stand here and say our effort wasn\\'t good.
